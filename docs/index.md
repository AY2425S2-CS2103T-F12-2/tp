**EasyWeds is a desktop application for streamlining wedding planning by centralising vendor and client information, ensuring planners can quickly access contacts, track event schedules, and manage multiple weddings efficiently.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

- If you are interested in using EasyWeds, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.md#quick-start).
